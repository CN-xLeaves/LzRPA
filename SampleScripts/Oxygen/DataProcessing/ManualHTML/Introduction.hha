Oxygen Basic (o2H) is a Just-In-Time compiler assembler, deployed in a single DLL that takes source code strings and returns
 executable binary. It is an extension of the Oxygen assembler. This implementation can be used with thinBasic
 to provide high speed functions for time critical operations, that would otherwise be impractical using
 interpreted code alone. The compiler can also generate conventional executables and dynamic link libraries (DLL).
<br><br>
Oxygen supports Object Oriented Programming with multiple inheritance and also single inheritance modes, more
 suited to COM. In addition to this O2H supports User-defined operators and operator sets for use with
 complex numbers, matrices, vectors, sets and other specialised forms. It can also compile & execute strings
 of source code at run time with its built in compile() function, opening new possibilities for functional
 programming.
<br><br>
The built in function set is small. but contains the necessary tools to build class / function libraries
 to any scale.
<br><br>
Oxygen can interact directly with thinBasic Variables - including User-Defined Types, or it can return values
 using Subs and Functions like an external DLL.
<br><br>
In addition to understanding Basic in the QBasic genre, Oxygen can read sufficient C syntax to deal with most
 C headers directly, eliminating the need to translate them.
